<TITLE> Oxford MAMLS Lodging </TITLE>
</p>

Every hotel room in Oxford is apparently reserved already for the weekend of April 26-27, but rooms for the Oxford MAMLS conference are being
held at <a href="http://huestonwoodslodge.com/">The Hueston Woods Lodge</a> until a month before the meeting. Mention "the Miami Math Conference" to reserve one of these rooms. Rooms may still be available at the <a href="http://www.whitegardeninn.com/">White Garden Inn</a> and <a href="http://www.presidiopinesbedandbreakfast.com/">Presidio Pines</a>.
